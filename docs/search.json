We’ll narrow down the scope to locations in the Klang Valley (KL, PJ and Shah Alam, in the datasets; since I’m most familiar with and most interested in this metro).\nDetermining the cuisine of a restaurant was mostly fairly obvious, and the categories hopefully self-explanatory. Additional notes on the coding of these cuisines may be found in the appendices.\nLet’s start first with an overview of both datasets, now with cuisines included. From the plot below, we see that:\n\nSouth Asian, Chinese, Casual Western, Japanese and Bars are the most commonly-reviewed restaurants in the Klang Valley. These are not the most commonly-visited restaurants.\nChinese, Casual Western, Malaysian and Thai are the lowest-rated cuisines.\nFusion, Other Upmarket (experiential dining or unspecified “international” cuisine) and bars have the highest ratings, with 60% or more of all reviews being five stars.\nTrip Advisor and Google reviewers differ the most on their opinions of Levantine, Casual Western and Japanese restaurants.\nThe x-axes on the plots below show the percentage of reviews that are five stars by cuisine. This actually provides much more differentiation than just the mean rating, as we will discuss in the next section."

    "text": "Comparisons of average ratings\nWith reference to the histograms below, that ratings are skewed towards the higher end: the mean rating of restaurants on Google is 4.16 and the mean rating on Trip Advisor is 4.22. The median and mode for both datasets is 5.\nIt really could be said that the default review rating is five stars. This means that restaurant reviews on these platforms are very lax. It is hard for me to believe that half of all reviews were about a truly exceptional dining experience: 51.87% of all ratings in the Google dataset for the Klang Valley are five stars; in Trip Advisor, it was 52.79%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo take an immediate point of action, if a restaurant that you would like to try has a review summary chart more heavily weighted to the bottom than the charts above, it\nGiven that reviews are limited to a one-to-five scale, there is not very much differentiation amongst how restaurants are rated. In the scatterplots below, we note restaurants that almost all restaurants mostly receive five stars (blue) or four stars (green). This means that neither Google nor Trip Advisor ratings are particularly useful at distinguishing between restaurants.\nThe number of total reviews is correlated with mean rating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both Google and Trip\nJust having these two sets of reviews to examine,\nAre reviews useful? The commonality of five-star reviews indicate that the mean rating is more likely an indicator of expectations being met rather than any true excellence.\nThese differences probably come down to the reviewers on Google and Trip Advisor and their respective purposes. Google reviewers are often locals or general consumers, whilst Trip Advisor reviewers tend to be travellers who have to provide more structured, specific reviews, leading to less casual reviews as there is a minimum word count required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle and TripAdvisor users seem to agree more than disagree. Five-star\nIt’s possible that reviews are useless.\nGood service and environment can prevent a one-star review. Humans are crazy and feel debts viscerally. Separate food from service and waiters? But restaurants don’t do that. Dining is an experience, and all aspects of the experience are vital.\nIs it fair to say that locals and more casual reviewers favour localised,\nSome deserve their four stars Specialities can get you really far\nThis is one of those subjects where we all have experience. And that experience is applicable.\nFor me, I see that the more localised, longstanding levantine (Bedouin and Istanbul) restaurants are much more popular on Google (with locals), rather than on Trip Advisor with many more expats and travellers.\nMaybe there should be separate scores for the food and the service?

    "section": "Conclusions: Part one",
    "text": "Conclusions: Part one\nLet’s review what we’ve learnt from the datasets:\n\nReviews skew very heavily towards five stars. Roughly half of all reviews give five stars. This means that Google Maps and TripAdvisor should be used to decide where not to eat, as opposed as where to eat since five stars means a restaurant could mean anything from “met expectations” to “truly exceptional”. Though much less numerous, one-, two- and three-starred reviews are much more informative than reading five star reviews. I will try sorting restaurant reviews by the lowest first, so I can avoid places that could be very disappointing.\nIn fact, re-sorting your data will likely provide better results. Since you can also pay Google for visibility, looking at the tops results provides a very distorted view of the area in question. It is better to look through data without\n\nIn spite of all this, I still haven’t learnt anything that I instinctually did not know. In my day-to-day life, when engaging with online reviews, I’m still forced to engage with reviews individually, apart from the summary chart\nThat the places where food is most commonly consumed, outside the home.\nOutside of the home, hawker centres and coffee shops are places where food is most commonly consumed. Yet these businesses are not reviewed with anywhere the same frequency as the casual western eateries or chinese restaurants/dai chows. Food we consume every day is not subject to the same expectations as fine dining. But even more casual dining options warrant reviews.\nOr, the system could be skewed against hawkers. It is difficult to mark individual hawkers since they operate from within the premises of another business. Additionally, hawkers are much less likely to engage with Google or Trip Advisor to curate or market their online presence, leading to these platforms being blind to the needs of hawkers and continue to cater towards restaurants. Restaurants do spend on marketing (i.e. paying for visibility on Google Maps)\n\n\n# A tibble: 53 × 2\n   restaurant                                         n\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                          &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Din Tai Fung 鼎泰豐 at The Gardens Mall          792\n 2 Old Shanghai                                     599\n 3 Lai Po Heen                                      336\n 4 Ah Sang Bak Kut Teh                              300\n 5 Boon Signature Roast Pork                        300\n 6 Din Tai Fung 鼎泰豐 at 1 Utama Shopping Centre   300\n 7 Dolly Dim Sum, NU Sentral                        300\n 8 Fatty Mee Hoon Kuih                              300\n 9 Hakka Restaurant                                 300\n10 Nam Heong Vintage, Pavilion Elite                300\n# ℹ 43 more rows"
